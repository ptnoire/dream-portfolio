I want a website that truly reflects my personality, so best way to do that is to just make it from scratch.

TODO: Fix blog section, code snippets posted on medium don't show up on the  blog page, and overall just fix the formatting it was done kind of lazily.
Fix the image on the about me page, I switched from the custom font to a image because the custom font was absolutely destroying the page's performance, 
  do this again with the main title so it will stop loading old fonts before it uploads the new one. Sad cause it was cool but ultimately not needed.
